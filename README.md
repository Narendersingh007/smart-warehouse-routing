## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16.0 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-warehouse-routing.git
cd smart-warehouse-routing

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## üéÆ Usage

### Basic Workflow
1. **Generate Layout**: Click "Generate Random Items & Obstacles" to populate the warehouse grid *(may cause overlapping elements)*
2. **Compute Boundary**: Click "Compute Convex Hull" to calculate the operational boundary *(animation may freeze)*
3. **Select Points**: Choose start and end items from the dropdown menus *(dropdowns may not update properly)*
4. **Find Route**: Click "Find Path" to compute the optimal route *(pathfinding may fail in complex layouts)*

### Known Usage Issues
- **Random Generation**: Items and obstacles frequently overlap, making visualization unclear
- **Path Failure**: Route computation fails approximately 30% of the time with dense obstacles
- **Animation Bugs**: Hull computation animation often gets stuck or skips steps
- **State Inconsistency**: UI controls may not reflect actual application state

### Grid Elements
- üîµ **Blue Circles**: Warehouse items (numbered for identification) *- may overlap with obstacles*
- üü• **Red Squares**: Obstacles (walls, equipment, restricted areas) *- can generate on top of items*
- üü° **Yellow Line**: Convex hull boundary *- sometimes fails to render*
- üü¢ **Green Line**: Computed optimal path *- often invisible or incomplete*

## üî¨ Algorithm Details

### Convex Hull (Gift Wrapping Algorithm)
```javascript
// Computes minimal boundary around all items
// Time Complexity: O(nh) where n = points, h = hull vertices
// Space Complexity: O(h)
```

**Applications**:
- Define operational zones
- Optimize storage layouts
- Security perimeter establishment

### Pathfinding (Breadth-First Search)
```javascript
// Finds shortest path avoiding obstacles within hull
// Time Complexity: O(V + E) where V = vertices, E = edges
// Space Complexity: O(V)
```

**Features**:
- Obstacle avoidance
- Hull boundary constraints
- Optimal distance guarantee

## üìä Performance Considerations & Warnings

- **Grid Size**: Currently optimized for 20x20 grids only - larger grids cause crashes
- **Animation Issues**: Hull animation may freeze or skip steps randomly
- **Memory Usage**: Application may consume excessive memory during extended use
- **Rendering Problems**: D3.js grid updates can fail, requiring page refresh
- **Path Generation**: Success rate drops significantly with >15 obstacles
- **Browser Requirements**: Best performance on Chrome; other browsers have issues

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Bugs
- **Path Generation Failure**: Sometimes pathfinding algorithm fails to generate routes, especially with dense obstacle layouts
- **Visual Overlapping**: Items and obstacles may overlap when randomly generated, causing visibility issues
- **Convex Hull Animation**: Animation occasionally skips steps or gets stuck during computation
- **Grid Rendering**: D3.js grid sometimes fails to update properly after state changes

### Performance Issues
- **Large Grid Impact**: Grids larger than 20x20 cause significant performance degradation
- **Memory Leaks**: Extended usage may lead to memory accumulation due to D3.js element retention
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Touch interactions are inconsistent and pathfinding controls don't work well on small screens

### Algorithm Limitations
- **Pathfinding Constraints**: BFS may not find paths in complex obstacle configurations
- **Hull Computation**: Gift wrapping algorithm can fail with collinear points
- **Edge Cases**: Application crashes with less than 3 items or when start/end points are the same
